# Dodecastar

Star-shaped 3D printable object "useful" as a lamp shade
for a string of ws2812b addressable LEDs or for Xmas 
decoration lights.

Written in openscad. To visualize light reflection, it 
could be exported to "OFF" format and imported into Blender
(some example also included with pictures).
